    "\n",
    "A Python program does not need anything special to start. If you just write code at the top level of a file, it will run immediately when executing the script **and** when importing the script into another file.<br>\n",
    "For that reason, it is common practice to use the following guard to ensure that certain code only runs if the file is executed directly, and not when it is imported as a module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# some code (classes and functions)\n",
    "# ...\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    # run your code\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `__name__` is a special built-in variable in Python.\n",
    "* When a file is run directly, `__name__` is set to `\"__main__\"`.\n",
    "* When a file is imported, `__name__` is set to the module‚Äôs name instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to write Python files that can both:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Be used as **standalone programs**\n",
    "2. Be imported as **modules** without executing unnecessary code\n",

    "### Indents / Seperate Scopes\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, code blocks (bodies of control elements, loops, and functions) are not defined with curly braces `{}` like in C++ or Java. Instead, **indentation (spaces at the beginning of a line)** defines the scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is why consistent indentation is **very important** in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recommended: **4 spaces per indent level** (PEP 8 style guide)\n",
    "* Do **not mix tabs and spaces**, as they may look the same but are treated differently by Python OR make sure that `tab` are converted into 4 spaces, then you can also mix them\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if True:\n",
    "    print(\"Heyyyyy\")                       # indented = inside the if-body\n",
    "    print(\"Another line inside of the if\") # indented = inside the if-body\n",
    "print(\"outside\")       # no indent = outside the if-body\n",
    "\n",
    "def hello():\n",
    "    print(\"hello\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If indentation is inconsistent, Python will throw an `IndentationError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> üí° Most IDEs or text editors can be configured to automatically convert a `Tab` into 4 spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "An empty body/scope can also be done by using the `pass` keyword. Following example shows that:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if True:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    pass\n",

    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course we need variables to store values/data over short or long time and we will in later lectures see about all data types but first have a look about how to define/instantiate and access variables in Python.<br>\n",
    "In Python you only have to define/instantiate a variable by using the `=` sign. On the **left side** is the variable name and on the **right side** the value or an expression. The expression will be evaluated first, then assigned to the variable. **In Python a variable is always an instance of a data-type/class.**<br>\n",
    "Python determines the data type **automatically** (dynamic typing), and you cannot declare the type manually like in C++ or Java.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Accessing is also as easy as that: just use the variable name.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 1\n",
    "print(x)     # output: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "x = x + 2    # or shorthand: x += 2\n",
    "print(x)     # output: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multiple assignments at once:\n",
    "a, b, c = 1, 2, 3\n",
    "print(a, b, c)  # output: 1 2 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "**Variable Naming Rules**\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable names must follow some rules and conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Allowed**:\n",
    "* Letters (a‚Äìz, A‚ÄìZ)\n",
    "* Digits (0‚Äì9), but **not as the first character**\n",
    "* Underscore (`_`)\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùå **Not allowed**:\n",
    "* Spaces or special characters like `@`, `$`, `%`, `-`, etc.\n",
    "* Starting with a digit (`2value` is invalid, but `value2` is fine)\n",
    "* Using reserved **keywords** (like `class`, `def`, `if`, `for`, ‚Ä¶) -> [see also here](#keywords).\n",
    "\n",
    "üìå **Conventions (good practice)**:\n",
    "* Use descriptive names (`age` instead of `a`)\n",
    "* Use `snake_case` for normal variables (`user_name`, `item_count`)\n",
    "* Constants are usually written in `UPPER_CASE` (`PI = 3.14`)\n",
    "* By convention, a leading underscore `_var` suggests ‚Äúinternal use‚Äù\n",
    "* `_` can be used for variables with no use or temporary use (for example when a function returns 2 values, but you only need one of them: `x, _ = my_func()`)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Special Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variables in Python are just **names (references)** pointing to objects in memory (heap), because all variables are just pointers to objects, so all values are objects in Python. That means you can reassign them to different types at any time:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    x = 42\n",
    "    x = \"hello\"\n",
    "    print(x)   # now it's a string\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* If you want to assign the same value to multiple variables at once:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    a = b = c = 0\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* Temporary variables often use `_`, for example in loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "So variables are just references to objects in the heap and in Python we also can delete such objects with the `del` keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "v_1 = 100023\n",
    "v_2 = 3948598\n",

    "**1. Global Variables**\n",

    "### List Comprehension\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehension is a **compact way to create lists** in Python. It allows you to generate a new list by applying an **expression** to each item in an iterable (like a list, tuple, or range), optionally filtering items with a condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Syntax**\n",

    "\n",
    "* `expression` ‚Üí what you want each element in the new list to be\n",
    "* `item` ‚Üí variable representing each element from `iterable`\n",
    "* `iterable` ‚Üí any Python iterable (list, tuple, string, range, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squared = [x**2 for x in numbers]\n",
    "print(squared)  # output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",

    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**With a Condition (Filtering)**\n",

    "**Notes / Best Practices**\n",

    "* **Readability matters:** don‚Äôt make list comprehensions too long or complex.\n",

    "### Wrapping and merging lines\n",

    "In Python you can use the `\\\\`-Backslash to **split one line into multiple**. This is needed for too long lines:\n",

    "x \\\n",
    "= \\\n",
    "10\n",
    "\n",
    "t = \"hey \\\n",

    "for i in range(1, 10): print(f\"{i=}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This only works with single statements in the control elements (`if`, `for`, ...). For multiple statements you can wrap multiple expressions into one expression (with sub-expressions) using round brackets `(` `)`:\n",
